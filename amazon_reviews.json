        "Review_Body": "I am preparing for UGC NET exam and I heard from my professors that there is a site called Toppersnotes which was very helpful for those who wants to clear the same... And they are saying that in Amazon they are giving a very good discount so i purchase from Amazon. literally there are low rates. If i am talk about the book all the concepts are given in the book is step by step wise and explain through mindmaps whenever needed the language is so simple that a student also read it. If i talk about information it's summary type but you can still prepare from the same for your revision. I ü§îü§î it will more helpful for my revisions too. That's all I want to say last thing I want to say to the Toppersnotes faculties thankyou so much for sharing your thoughts and knowledge with us in the form of these book üìöüìöüìö......"

        "Review_Body": "If you are preparing for such a high level exam definitely not worth buying... It looks like some amateur has used voice recognition typing feature and has not gone through the trouble to proofread it at all. So many grammatical mistakes and so much of repetition. Do not buy these books extremely useless."
